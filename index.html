          <p>
              To begin with, I´m Gabriel Preciado born and raised in Bogota, Colombia, on 
              the city’s center neighborhoods where interesting things happen every day. 
              There, I grew up to be a calm and reserved person with a little bit of humor 
              because being able to make a joke every day, that´s life to me. In this way, 
              I have to say that my main goal in life is the pursuit of interestingness where 
              my curiosity can be satisfied.

            <p>
                On my educational and professional background, I´m practical and result-oriented person, 
                <strong>always looking not just for answers but the right questions to ask. </strong> In this way, on 
                my research and work-related projects I focus on three stages: <strong> Data wrangling, Analytics 
                and Results Presentations.</strong>

                    <td class="col1"><strong>Data wrangling</strong></td>
                    <td>I have a virtual machine where I do all my 
                      work but if it’s needed. My main cloud providers are GCP and AWS
                      where I do all my jobs and pipelines.</td>

                  <tr>
                    <td class="col1"><strong>Analytics </strong></td>
                    <td>In this field, my statistics, machine learning and 
                      econometrics comes as my analytics toolbox. When I do 
                      models, I always try to be robust but, as a economist, 
                      I’m aware that statistical significance is not enough, 
                      sometimes theory must be implemented as well.</td>

                  <tr>
                    <td class="col1"><strong>Results Presentation </strong></td>
                    <td>I think that soft skills really matters for presentation, 
                      sometimes more than data wrangling and analytics. In this 
                      section, I train myself writing blogs, giving speeches and 
                      explain everything that I do to anyone.</td>
